    "text": "Key Takeaways / Common Mistakes\n\nDemographics information is required for every patient. Try your best to acquire it.\nPro Tip: Ask for their ID!\nChief complaint should be in quotes (e.g., “I drank too much,” not EtOH). If unresponsive or incomprehensible, document as:\n&gt; “None (Unresponsive/Incomprehensible)”\nIf A+O status is less than 4, document exactly what the patient could not report or what led you to conclude the patient was altered.\nE.g.: “Unaware of current location/city”\nIn systems assessment, document both signs and symptoms and pertinent negatives.\nE.g.: Cardiovascular: “Pedal edema.” Neurological: “CSMs in all extremities intact.”\nKnow the difference between WNL and NA:\n\nUse WNL (Within Normal Limits) if the system is relevant and you have assessed it to be normal.\n\nUse NA (Not Applicable/Assessed) if the system is irrelevant to the call.\n\nFor allergies, medications, and past medical history:\nIf none reported, do not leave blank. Write:\n&gt; “None reported/Pt denies”\nIf you make a mistake and would like to redact information, never scratch it out or obstruct it\n\nDraw a horizontal line through it and write the correction next to the line if applicable\n\nDo not use acronyms like ‘SAMPLE’ or ‘OPQRST’ in your narrative. You can perform assessments using these mnemonics to remember what to look for, but the narrative should only contain your actual findings.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "I am not currently an EMT. Can I still enroll in the course or join BMRC?  Yes, however the course is mandatory for all new BMRC members to take, and we have limited space. This means that first priority for enrollment codes goes to new members, then general members, then other students at UC Berkeley. It is uncommon for spots to remain after codes are released to BMRC members. To become a BMRC member, you must be Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician with California State licensure (grey card).\nThat said, non-EMTs are welcome and encouraged to attend our public presentations from 7–8 PM on Mondays and Tuesdays. These are a great way to learn more about what it’s like to be an EMT and a BMRC member. For details, visit our Instagram: @mrcberkeley.\n Will there be live webcasts or recordings of lectures?  No. Lectures are in-person only and will not be streamed or recorded. Attendance is required.\n Do you have a COVID or illness policy?  Yes. If you’re feeling unwell or have been recently exposed to illness, please stay home. If you anticipate missing a class due to illness, email the course administrators at admininstration@berkeleymrc.org to inform them.\n Are time conflicts allowed with the course?  No. If you will consistently miss a portion of training (e.g., due to another class), you should not enroll.\n What is the uniform policy for trainings?  All members are expected to attend training in half uniform (BMRC T-shirt or quarter-zip, EMT pants, and boots).\n How do I sign up for MedOps events?  Sign up by commenting your name in the appropriate cell on the event sign-up Google Sheet. You can also view the calendar of posted events and openings on the MedOps Events page.\n How do I become an FTO?  FTO applications open a few weeks before each semester and are available only to current members who are not on probation. You cannot be an FTO during your new member semester.\n What’s the difference between an FTO and an FTO intern?  Both FTOs and FTO interns assist with training. However, FTOs lead teams at events and are responsible for patient care, communication with venue staff and EMS resources, and documentation. Interns support FTOs and gain experience for future leadership.\n Where can I find example PCRs?  Example PCRs are located at the bottom of the PCRs page.\n How do I sign up for Public Health events?  Public Health events are reserved for members who have completed a semester’s PH training. Sign-up sheets are posted in Slack whenever an event is announced. Be sure to check Slack regularly and follow the sign-up instructions at the top of the sheet.\n How do I become a PHO (Public Health Officer)?  PHOs serve as trusted representatives at Public Health events (excluding CPR). To become a PHO, maintain good standing in BMRC and PH Instruction, and complete the application form sent out via Slack at the end of each semester. For details, refer to the Roles and Responsibilities document.\n How do I join the board?  Board applications open toward the end of every fall semester and include role descriptions and expectations. Selected applicants begin as “incoming board members” in the spring semester and will be mentored by current board members.\n Who do I contact about reimbursements?  Please fill out the reimbursement form\n What is Rock Med?  Rock Medicine (Rock Med) is a volunteer EMS program that provides medical support at concerts and music festivals. Learn more on the Rock Med page.",

    "text": "Course Structure\n\nWeekly Topics\nEach week will focus on a different emergency medicine topic or feature a guest speaker. Class time includes student-led presentations and scenarios.\n\n\nAttendance\nClasses are held Mondays or Tuesdays from 6–8pm. In-person attendance at one of the two weekly sessions is required unless excused for illness or emergency. Attendance is recorded via iClicker. A maximum of two unexcused absences is allowed. During excused absences, Zoom recordings and a makeup assignment will be provided if available.\n\n\nReadings\nBrief primers (1–2 pages) will be shared as PDFs on bCourses prior to each class. Where readings are TBD or a guest speaker is scheduled, relevant material will be provided one week in advance. These may include news articles, research, or student-made primers.\n\n\nPresentations\nStarting the second class, students will sign up for a topic and work in groups of 2–5. They will research, prepare a 40–60 minute interactive presentation, and develop three EMT-level case scenarios. Preparation includes slide review with facilitators, and teams are expected to rehearse in advance. The estimated workload is 8 hours.\nNon-presenting students will take notes and submit a post-class reflection through bCourses, listing three takeaways or questions. Students will also complete two mid-semester feedback forms and a final reflection.\n\n\nScenarios and Quizzes\nShort scenario-based quizzes will be posted on bCourses each week. After the submission deadline, full solutions will be provided.\n\n\nEMS Engagement\nStudents are required to participate in at least 3 EMS engagement opportunities outside the classroom, such as event staffing through BMRC or Rock Medicine, ride-alongs and ambulance work, or teaching public health classes. Those unable to do so should contact instructors as soon as possible to complete alternative method of engagement.",
